# YouTube Clone Project

This project is a clone of YouTube, aiming to replicate some of its core features such as video browsing, searching, and playback. It utilizes React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The project also includes routing using React Router, API integration for fetching video data, and responsive design for a seamless user experience across devices.


**Features:**

1. **Navigation:** The Navbar component provides navigation links for browsing different sections of the application, including the home page, search page, and video playback.

2. **Search:** Users can search for videos using the search bar in the Navbar. Typing a query and submitting the form triggers a search action, fetching relevant videos from the YouTube API and displaying them on the search results page.

3. **Video Playback:** Clicking on a video thumbnail navigates users to the video playback page, where they can watch the selected video. The video player supports basic playback controls and fullscreen mode.

4. **Infinite Scroll:** The home page and search results page implement infinite scrolling, dynamically loading more videos as the user scrolls down the page. This provides a seamless browsing experience without requiring users to navigate to separate pages.

5. **Recommended Videos:** Upon watching a video, users are presented with a list of recommended videos based on their viewing history. These recommendations are fetched from the YouTube API and displayed on the video playback page.

6. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, ensuring consistent layout and user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
